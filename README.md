# game-discount-finder

## Description

This application allows users to find deals on games with the options to sort them by name, store, and ascending/descending in price. It gives a list of games that are currently being given away for free. It was made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Fetch API, jQuery API- AJAX, cheapshark API, Gamerpower API, Rapid API, and Materilize CSS framework. It was made so that gamers would be able to find and enjoy their favorite games for cheaper than they would usually be able to find, and as a way to practice using our API, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML skills.
